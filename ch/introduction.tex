\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{framed}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Short history of SC (from Onnes to BCS)
        \item The discovery of LBCO and a brief overview of unconventional superconductivty
        \item Cuprates and competing orders (the possibility of many near-degenerate orders motivates this thesis)
        \item Microscopic vs Macroscopic (motivates the use of spectroscopic methods)
    \end{itemize}
