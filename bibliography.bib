  abstract = {We present a volume-sensitive high-energy x-ray diffraction study of the underdoped cuprate high temperature superconductor La2-xSrxCuO4 (x = 0.12, Tc=27 K) in applied magnetic field. Bulk short-range charge stripe order with propagation vector q\_ch = (0.231, 0, 0.5) is demonstrated to exist below T\_ch = 85(10) K and shown to compete with superconductivity. We argue that bulk charge ordering arises from fluctuating stripes that become pinned near boundaries between orthorhombic twin domains.},

The spin fluctuations are incommensurate with the lattice and have spatial, energy, and temperature dependencies very much like those in La2- xSrxCuO4, with similar high transition temperature.

  abstract = {Despite over two decades of intense research efforts, the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides remains elusive. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments1,2 have revealed a kink in the dispersion relations (energy versus wavevector) of electronic states in the copper oxides at binding energies of 50-80 meV, raising the hope that this anomaly could be a key to understanding high-temperature superconductivity. The kink is often interpreted in terms of interactions between the electrons and a bosonic field. Although there is no consensus on the nature of the bosons (or even whether a boson model is appropriate), both phonons1 and spin fluctuations2 have been proposed as possible candidates. Here we report first-principles calculations of the role of phonons and the electron\textendash{}phonon interaction in the photoemission spectra of La2 - xSrxCuO4. Our calculations within the standard formalism demonstrate that the phonon-induced renormalization of the electron energies and the Fermi velocity is almost one order of magnitude smaller than the effect observed in photoemission experiments. Therefore, our result rules out electron\textendash{}phonon interaction in bulk La2 - xSrxCuO4 as the exclusive origin of the measured kink. Our conclusions are consistent with those reached independently in a recent study3 of the related compound YBa2Cu3O7.},

  volume = {89},
  abstract = {In superconducting copper oxides, some Cu-O bond-stretching phonons around 70 meV show anomalous giant softening and broadening of electronic origin, and electronic dispersions have large renormalization kinks near the same energy. These observations suggest that phonon broadening originates from quasiparticle excitations across the Fermi surface and the electronic dispersion kinks originate from coupling to anomalous phonons. We measured the phonon anomaly in underdoped (x=0.05) and overdoped (x=0.20 and 0.25) La2-xSrxCuO4 by inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering with high resolution. Combining these and previously published data, we found that doping dependence of the magnitude of the giant phonon anomaly is very different from that of the ARPES kink, i.e., the two phenomena are not connected. We show that these results provide indirect evidence that the phonon anomaly originates from novel collective charge excitations as opposed to interactions with electron-hole pairs. Their amplitude follows the superconducting dome so these charge modes may be important for superconductivity.},

  abstract = {It has recently been established that the high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconducting state coexists with short-range charge-density-wave order1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 and quenched disorder12,13 arising from dopants and strain14,15,16,17. This complex, multiscale phase separation18,19,20,21 invites the development of theories of high-temperature superconductivity that include complexity22,23,24,25. The nature of the spatial interplay between charge and dopant order that provides a basis for nanoscale phase separation remains a key open question, because experiments have yet to probe the unknown spatial distribution at both the nanoscale and mesoscale (between atomic and macroscopic scale). Here we report micro X-ray diffraction imaging of the spatial distribution of both short-range charge-density-wave `puddles' (domains with only a few wavelengths) and quenched disorder in HgBa2CuO4 + y, the single-layer cuprate with the highest Tc, 95 kelvin (refs 26, 27, 28). We found that the charge-density-wave puddles, like the steam bubbles in boiling water, have a fat-tailed size distribution that is typical of self-organization near a critical point19. However, the quenched disorder, which arises from oxygen interstitials, has a distribution that is contrary to the usually assumed random, uncorrelated distribution12,13. The interstitial-oxygen-rich domains are spatially anticorrelated with the charge-density-wave domains, because higher doping does not favour the stripy charge-density-wave puddles, leading to a complex emergent geometry of the spatial landscape for superconductivity.},

  abstract = {Electronic functionalities in materials from silicon to transition metal oxides are, to a large extent, controlled by defects and their relative arrangement. Outstanding examples are the oxides of copper, where defect order is correlated with their high superconducting transition temperatures. The oxygen defect order can be highly inhomogeneous, even in optimal superconducting samples, which raises the question of the nature of the sample regions where the order does not exist but which nonetheless form the ``glue'' binding the ordered regions together. Here we use scanning X-ray microdiffraction (with a beam 300 nm in diameter) to show that for La2CuO4+y, the glue regions contain incommensurate modulated local lattice distortions, whose spatial extent is most pronounced for the best superconducting samples. For an underdoped single crystal with mobile oxygen interstitials in the spacer La2O2+y layers intercalated between the CuO2 layers, the incommensurate modulated local lattice distortions form droplets anticorrelated with the ordered oxygen interstitials, and whose spatial extent is most pronounced for the best superconducting samples. In this simplest of high temperature superconductors, there are therefore not one, but two networks of ordered defects which can be tuned to achieve optimal superconductivity. For a given stoichiometry, the highest transition temperature is obtained when both the ordered oxygen and lattice defects form fractal patterns, as opposed to appearing in isolated spots. We speculate that the relationship between material complexity and superconducting transition temperature Tc is actually underpinned by a fundamental relation between Tc and the distribution of ordered defect networks supported by the materials.},

These observations support real-space electronic phase separation in the crystal, where the static stripes in one phase are pinned versions of the dynamic stripes in the other, having slightly different periods.

As shown in previous work, these samples spontaneously phase separate into an oxygen-rich superconducting phase with a TC near 40 K and an oxygen poor magnetic phase that also orders near 40 K. The oxygenated samples studied are highly magnetically reversible even to low temperatures. Although the internal magnetic regions of these samples might be expected to act as pinning sites, our present study shows that they do not favor flux pinning. Flux pinning requires a matching condition between the defect size and the superconducting coherence length. Thus, our results imply that the magnetic regions are too large to act as pinning centers. This also implies that the much greater flux pinning in typical La2-xSrxCuO4 materials is the result of nanoscale inhomogeneities that grow to become the large magnetic regions in the superoxygenated materials. The superconducting regions of the phase separated materials are in that sense cleaner and more homogenous than in the typical cuprate superconductor.},

Orthorhombic LSCO thus helps bridge the apparent disparities between the behavior previously observed in the tetragonal ``214'' cuprates and the orthorhombic yttrium and bismuth-based cuprates and thus lends strong support to the idea that there is a common motif to charge order in all cuprate families.},

The more controversial dynamic stripes, which are not detectable by diffraction, may be universally present in copper oxide superconductors. Thus it is important to learn how to detect dynamic stripes as well as to understand their influence on electronic properties. This review article focuses on lattice vibrations (phonons) that might show signatures of the charge component of dynamic stripes. The first part of the article describes recent progress in learning about how the phonon signatures of different types of electronic charge fluctuations including stripes can be distinguished from purely structural instabilities and from each other. Then I will focus on the evidence for dynamic stripes in the phonon spectra of copper oxide superconductors.},

A model structure originally proposed for La2NiO4 + {$\delta$} can account for the superlattice peaks as a result of anti-phase domain boundaries between different tilt directions of the CuO6 octahedra. Within this model, the changes in CuO6 tilt directions are induced by segregated layers of interstitial oxygen which order in a manner similar to intercalants in graphite. This structural model thus clarifies previous work and establishes La2CuO4 + {$\delta$} as a unique lamellar superconducting system with annealed disorder.},

The conventional superconductor MgB2 has a very strong electron\textendash{}lattice coupling, involving a particular vibrational mode (phonon) that was predicted by standard theory and confirmed quantitatively by experiment5. Here we present inelastic scattering measurements that show a similarly strong anomaly in the Cu\textendash{}O bond-stretching phonon in the copper oxide superconductors La2-xSrxCuO4 (with x = 0.07, 0.15). Conventional theory does not predict such behaviour. The anomaly is strongest in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 and La1.48Nd0.4Sr0.12CuO4, compounds that exhibit spatially modulated charge and magnetic order, often called stripe order6; it occurs at a wave vector corresponding to the charge order. These results suggest that this giant electron\textendash{}phonon anomaly, which is absent in undoped and over-doped non-superconductors, is associated with charge inhomogeneity. It follows that electron\textendash{}phonon coupling may be important to our understanding of superconductivity, although its contribution is likely to be indirect.},

In the two years since this Nobel-prize-winning discovery, a large number of electronic structure calculations have been carried out as a first step in understanding the electronic properties of these materials. In this paper these calculations (mostly of the density-functional type) are gathered and reviewed, and their results are compared with the relevant experimental data. The picture that emerges is one in which the important electronic states are dominated by the copper d and oxygen p orbitals, with strong hybridization between them. Photon, electron, and positron spectroscopies provide important information about the electronic states, and comparison with electronic structure calculations indicates that, while many features can be interpreted in terms of existing calculations, self-energy corrections ("correlations") are important for a more detailed understanding. The antiferromagnetism that occurs in some regions of the phase diagram poses a particularly challenging problem for any detailed theory. The study of structural stability, lattice dynamics, and electron-phonon coupling in the copper oxides is also discussed. Finally, a brief review is given of the attempts so far to identify interaction constants appropriate for a model Hamiltonian treatment of many-body interactions in these materials.},

  abstract = {The last decade witnessed significant progress in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and its applications. Today, ARPES experiments with 2-meV energy resolution and 0.2\textdegree{} angular resolution are a reality even for photoemission on solids. These technological advances and the improved sample quality have enabled ARPES to emerge as a leading tool in the investigation of the high-Tc superconductors. This paper reviews the most recent ARPES results on the cuprate superconductors and their insulating parent and sister compounds, with the purpose of providing an updated summary of the extensive literature. The low-energy excitations are discussed with emphasis on some of the most relevant issues, such as the Fermi surface and remnant Fermi surface, the superconducting gap, the pseudogap and d-wave-like dispersion, evidence of electronic inhomogeneity and nanoscale phase separation, the emergence of coherent quasiparticles through the superconducting transition, and many-body effects in the one-particle spectral function due to the interaction of the charge with magnetic and/or lattice degrees of freedom. Given the dynamic nature of the field, we chose to focus mainly on reviewing the experimental data, as on the experimental side a general consensus has been reached, whereas interpretations and related theoretical models can vary significantly. The first part of the paper introduces photoemission spectroscopy in the context of strongly interacting systems, along with an update on the state-of-the-art instrumentation. The second part provides an overview of the scientific issues relevant to the investigation of the low-energy electronic structure by ARPES. The rest of the paper is devoted to the experimental results from the cuprates, and the discussion is organized along conceptual lines: normal-state electronic structure, interlayer interaction, superconducting gap, coherent superconducting peak, pseudogap, electron self-energy, and collective modes. Within each topic, ARPES data from the various copper oxides are presented.},

  volume = {65},
  abstract = {The effect of hydrostatic pressure up to 2 GPa on the superconductiong transitions in La2-xSrxCuO4+{$\delta$} is investigated. The ambient- and high-pressure properties of two series of samples with x=0 and 0.015 and 0{$<\delta{}<$}0.1 are characterized and compared by ac-susceptibility measurements. At ambient pressure both sets of samples fit into the same phase diagram as a function of the total hole concentration nh. For nh{$<$}0.085 there is a single superconducting transition (Tc{$\approx$}30K) with an unusually large pressure coefficient, dT(30)c/dp{$\approx$}10K/GPa. At a higher hole density (nh{$>$}0.085) a second superconducting transition (Tc{$\approx$}15K) follows the first transition upon cooling and the pressure shift of this transition is negative, dT(15)c/dp{$\approx{}-$}4K/GPa. At the boundary as the hole density is close to 0.085 the phase separation can be induced by pressure. The results are explained in terms of a strong correlation of the interstitial oxygen with the hole system in the CuO planes. Pressure, applied at ambient temperature, causes a redistribution of holes. The mobile oxygen dopants follow and enhance Tc as well as the tendency toward phase separation. If pressure is changed at low temperature ({$<$}100K) the effects on Tc and phase separations are greatly diminished because the interstitial oxygen becomes immobile at low T. Our results indicate that the dopant effects are important. Dopants and holes should be treated as a single globally correlated state. When thermodynamic euqilibrium is approached in the oxygen-doped samples, we find that there is an intrinsic tendency of electronic phase separation of doped holes into two distinct superconducting states.},

They compare and contrast the advantages of two limiting perspectives on the high-temperature superconductor: weak coupling, in which correlation effects are treated as a perturbation on an underlying metallic (although renormalized) Fermi-liquid state, and strong coupling, in which the magnetism is associated with well-defined localized spins, and stripes are viewed as a form of micro phase separation.

  abstract = {A growing number of cuprate superconductors show evidence of an intrinsic spatial electronic inhomogeneity on a nanometer length scale. Corresponding observations were made with a variety of probes sensitive to the sample's surface or bulk as well as to its average or local structure. Charge and spin stripe correlations constitute one class of inhomogeneity initially derived from neutron scattering data on La-based cuprates. By now magnetic excitation spectra with very similar dispersions were observed in several systems, suggesting that incommensurate spin fluctuations are a universal property of the cuprates. In contrast, it proves much harder to obtain a unified picture for the charge stripe correlations as observed with scattering and tunneling techniques. This article reviews the evidence of charge stripe correlations and their interactions with the crystal lattice in the La-based compounds, which are presently the only cuprates with confirmed static spin and charge stripe order. Particular emphasis is put on the relationship between stripe order and average and local structure properties, isotope effects, phonon anomalies, and doping dependencies. A second important topic concerns new insights obtained in studies of stripes under extreme conditions such as high magnetic fields and high pressure. Furthermore, the tilting of stripes in orthorhombic lattices will be discussed, as well as the possibility of diagonal charge stripes below the metal insulator transition, and alternative models for the stripe phase.},

  abstract = {It is well known that the microstructures of the transition-metal oxides1,2,3, including the high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) copper oxide superconductors4,5,6,7, are complex. This is particularly so when there are oxygen interstitials or vacancies8, which influence the bulk properties. For example, the oxygen interstitials in the spacer layers separating the superconducting CuO2 planes undergo ordering phenomena in Sr2O1+yCuO2 (ref. 9), YBa2Cu3O6+y (ref. 10) and La2CuO4+y (refs 11\textendash{}15) that induce enhancements in the transition temperatures with no changes in hole concentrations. It is also known that complex systems often have a scale-invariant structural organization16, but hitherto none had been found in high-Tc materials. Here we report that the ordering of oxygen interstitials in the La2O2+y spacer layers of La2CuO4+y high-Tc superconductors is characterized by a fractal distribution up to a maximum limiting size of 400 {$\mu$}m. Intriguingly, these fractal distributions of dopants seem to enhance superconductivity at high temperature.},

  issn = {1476-4687},
  abstract = {A superconductor is a material that can conduct electricity without resistance below a superconducting transition temperature, Tc. The highest Tc that has been achieved to date is in the copper oxide system1: 133 kelvin at ambient pressure2 and 164 kelvin at high pressures3. As the nature of superconductivity in these materials is still not fully understood (they are not conventional superconductors), the prospects for achieving still higher transition temperatures by this route are not clear. In contrast, the Bardeen\textendash{}Cooper\textendash{}Schrieffer theory of conventional superconductivity gives a guide for achieving high Tc with no theoretical upper bound\textemdash{}all that is needed is a favourable combination of high-frequency phonons, strong electron\textendash{}phonon coupling, and a high density of states4. These conditions can in principle be fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent compounds dominated by hydrogen5,6, as hydrogen atoms provide the necessary high-frequency phonon modes as well as the strong electron\textendash{}phonon coupling. Numerous calculations support this idea and have predicted transition temperatures in the range 50\textendash{}235 kelvin for many hydrides7, but only a moderate Tc of 17 kelvin has been observed experimentally8. Here we investigate sulfur hydride9, where a Tc of 80 kelvin has been predicted10. We find that this system transforms to a metal at a pressure of approximately 90 gigapascals. On cooling, we see signatures of superconductivity: a sharp drop of the resistivity to zero and a decrease of the transition temperature with magnetic field, with magnetic susceptibility measurements confirming a Tc of 203 kelvin. Moreover, a pronounced isotope shift of Tc in sulfur deuteride is suggestive of an electron\textendash{}phonon mechanism of superconductivity that is consistent with the Bardeen\textendash{}Cooper\textendash{}Schrieffer scenario. We argue that the phase responsible for high-Tc superconductivity in this system is likely to be H3S, formed from H2S by decomposition under pressure. These findings raise hope for the prospects for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in other hydrogen-based materials.},

  abstract = {Systematic and automatic calculations of the electronic band structure are a crucial component of computationally-driven high-throughput materials screening. An algorithm, for any crystal, to derive a unique description of the crystal structure together with a recommended band path is indispensable for this task. The electronic band structure is typically sampled along a path within the first Brillouin zone including the surface in reciprocal space. Some points in reciprocal space have higher site symmetries and/or have higher constraints than other points regarding the electronic band structure and therefore are likely to be more important than other points. This work categorizes points in reciprocal space according to their symmetry and provides recommended band paths that cover all special wavevector (k-vector) points and lines necessarily and sufficiently. Points in reciprocal space are labeled such that there is no conflict with the crystallographic convention. The k-vector coefficients of labeled points, which are located at Brillouin zone face and edge centers as well as vertices, are derived based on a primitive cell compatible with the crystallographic convention, including those with axial ratio-dependent coordinates. Furthermore, we provide an open-source implementation of the algorithms within our SeeK-path python code, to allow researchers to obtain k-vector coefficients and recommended band paths in an automated fashion. Finally, we created a free online service to compute and visualize the first Brillouin zone, labeled k-points and suggested band paths for any crystal structure, that we made available at http://www.materialscloud.org/tools/seekpath/.},

Increasing pressure causes the tilt angle of CuO6 octahedra to decrease, leading to a transition to tetragonal symmetry. There is a strong compressibility anisotropy for the orthorhombic structure. Order parameters for the transition versus pressure are consistent with Landau theory for a second-order transition. It is shown that this transition can be universally scaled over (x,T,P) space in the context of Landau theory. We conclude that Tc varies inversely with the tilt angle and is maximum for the tetragonal structure, i.e., for flat and square CuO2 planes, for this compound.},

  abstract = {ONE of the long-standing mysteries associated with the high-temperature copper oxide superconductors concerns the anomalous suppression1 of superconductivity in La2-xBaxCuO4 (and certain related compounds) when the hole concentration x is near {$\textfrac{1}{8}$}. Here we examine the possibility that this effect is related to dynamical two-dimensional spin correlations, incommensurate with the crystal lattice, that have been observed in La2-xSrxCuO4 by neutron scattering24. A possible explanation for the incommensurability involves a coupled, dynamical modulation of spin and charge in which antiferromagnetic 'stripes' of copper spins are separated by periodically spaced domain walls to which the holes segregate59. An ordered stripe phase of this type has recently been observed in hole-doped La2NiO4 (refs 1012). We present evidence from neutron diffraction that in the copper oxide material La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4, with x = 0.12, a static analogue of the dynamical stripe phase is present, and is associated with an anomalous suppression of superconductivity13,14. Our results thus provide an explanation of the '{$\textfrac{1}{8}$}' conundrum, and also support the suggestion15 that spatial modulations of spin and charge density are related to superconductivity in the copper oxides.},

  abstract = {In the copper oxide parent compounds of the high-transition-temperature superconductors1 the valence electrons are localized\textemdash{}one per copper site\textemdash{}by strong intra-atomic Coulomb repulsion. A symptom of this localization is antiferromagnetism2, where the spins of localized electrons alternate between up and down. Superconductivity appears when mobile `holes' are doped into this insulating state, and it coexists with antiferromagnetic fluctuations3. In one approach to describing the coexistence, the holes are believed to self-organize into `stripes' that alternate with antiferromagnetic (insulating) regions within copper oxide planes4, which would necessitate an unconventional mechanism of superconductivity5. There is an apparent problem with this picture, however: measurements of magnetic excitations in superconducting YBa2Cu3O6+x near optimum doping6 are incompatible with the naive expectations7,8 for a material with stripes. Here we report neutron scattering measurements on stripe-ordered La1.875Ba0.125CuO4. We show that the measured excitations are, surprisingly, quite similar to those in YBa2Cu3O6+x (refs 9, 10) (that is, the predicted spectrum of magnetic excitations7,8 is wrong). We find instead that the observed spectrum can be understood within a stripe model by taking account of quantum excitations. Our results support the concept that stripe correlations are essential to high-transition-temperature superconductivity11.},

ARPES studies of underdoped samples show a momentum dependence of the energy gap below  T c  which deviates from a simple  d -wave form, suggesting the coexistence of multiple energy scales in the superconducting state. Hence, two distinct energy scales have been introduced, namely, the gap near the node (characterized by {$\Delta$} 0 ) and in the anti-nodal region (characterized by {$\Delta$} * ). Dichotomy between them has been demonstrated from the material, doping, and temperature dependence of the energy gap. While {$\Delta$} *  at the same doping level is approximately material independent, {$\Delta$} 0  shows a strong material dependence tracking the magnitude of  T cmax . The anti-nodal gap does not close at  T c  in contrast to the gap near the node which follows something closer to a BCS-like temperature dependence.

The modifications induced in the CuO2 and the LaO planes by the insertion of oxygen are consistent with the high Tc measured for this material. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of La2CuO4.103(4) evidences an unexplained two-step mass loss process. Based on this observation, three samples obtained by different thermal treatments of the fully oxidized material were studied by TGA, X-ray diffraction and AC magnetic susceptibility. After a short treatment at 433 K, La2CuO4.103(4) undergoes a phase separation into two phases: phase 1, with estimated y1 = 0.086(4) and Tc1 = 30 K, and phase 2, with estimated y2 = 0.12(1) and Tc2 = 17 K. By increasing the annealing times, phase 2 transforms to phase 1 and finally disappears. Therefore, it seems likely that the plateau observed in the TGA curve of La2CuO4.103(4) might be due to the formation on heating of a stable phase with a fixed oxygen stoichiometry, i.e. La2CuO4.086(4). The stability of this phase could be related to the presence of one-dimensional interstitial oxygen ordering along the c-axis (stage 3), although no experimental evidence for this has been found.},

  abstract = {In order to investigate the on-site motion of the diffusive species in crystalline solids, we have implemented a code to perform a time-summation of displacements of specific atoms, involving symmetry and adapted projections. The resulting 2D maps have been called `positional recurrence maps' (PRM). Only displacements are considered, instead of positions, so static deformations are filtered out. In this paper we present the PRM method and show the type of information on the dynamics of selected atoms that can be obtained. We take, as an example, the Nd2NiO4+d system in which we were able to characterize in detail the effects of the dynamical delocalization of the apical oxygen.},

  abstract = {Nonstoichiometric Nd2NiO4+{$\delta$} shows oxygen ion mobility already at room temperature and as such is a promising material in the field of solid state ionic conductors. The present work aims to understand the impact of oxygen overstoichiometry on the lattice dynamics of the Nd2NiO4 framework and to correlate dynamic instabilities to the anionic mobility at room temperature. We performed neutron time-of-flight spectroscopy experiments coupled with DFT-based molecular dynamics calculations on the phases Nd2NiO4.0, Nd2NiO4.10, and Nd2NiO4.25. Specific signatures in the phonon density of states gave evidence that excess oxygen on interstitial lattice sites activates large displacements of the apical oxygen atoms along the [110] direction, thus favoring their diffusion toward interstitial sites within the rock salt-type layer already at ambient temperature. We implemented a position recurrence method to analyze apical oxygen displacements during the 40 ps time scale of molecular dynamics simulations. The results highlighted that dynamical delocalization of apical oxygen atoms along [110] is necessary to observe diffusion at room temperature, and thus ionic mobility at room temperature is activated by lattice dynamics.},

  abstract = {We report neutron diffraction studies on a series of La2NiO4+{$\delta$} single crystals with 0.05{$\lessequivlnt\delta\lessequivlnt$}0.11. At 300 K, all of the crystals have an average tetragonal structure (space group I4/mmm). On cooling below 290 K, one or more orthorhombic phases appear, characterized by incommensurate superlattice peaks at (0,k,l{$\pm\Delta$}) with k odd, l even, and 1/4{$<\Delta\leq$}1/2. The positions, widths, and intensities of the superlattice peaks are quite sensitive to the cooling rate. We show that the incommensurate peaks are evidence of intercalated layers of oxygen spaced periodically along the c axis, with a one-dimensional ordering similar to the staging of intercalates in graphite. The structure of the La2NiO4 lattice between the interstitial layers is of the Bmab-type; the superlattice peaks result from the ordered antiphase domain boundaries induced by the interstitial oxygens, which sit at (1/4, 1) / 4 , 1/4)-type positions. Observed orderings involve interstitial layers separated by two to four Ni-O layers. Peak shapes and positions are modelled quantitatively using the formulas of Hendricks and Teller for one-dimensional disorder in a layer lattice. Besides the one-dimensional ordering of the intercalant layers, temperature-dependent phase separations are observed. Because of the slow ordering kinetics, phase separation can be suppressed by rapid cooling.},

The spatial extent of the latter is related to transport properties, including superconductivity, and to the dispersion relation of spin excitations (magnons). Here, for three antiferromagnetic parent compounds (single-layer Bi2Sr0.9La1.1CuO6+{$\delta$}, double-layer Nd1.2Ba1.8Cu3O6 and infinite-layer CaCuO2) differing by the number of apical atoms, we compare the magnetic spectra measured by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering over a significant portion of the reciprocal space and with unprecedented accuracy. We observe that the absence of apical oxygens increases the in-plane hopping range and, in CaCuO2, it leads to a genuine three-dimensional (3D) exchange-bond network. These results establish a corresponding relation between the exchange interactions and the crystal structure, and provide fresh insight into the materials dependence of the superconducting transition temperature.},

  abstract = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order N3atoms operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special ``metric'' and a special ``preconditioning'' optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order N2atoms scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. \textcopyright{} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

Within this framework, we obtain the temperature dependence of a number of structural properties, including the cell volume, bulk modulus, and Gr{\"u}neisen parameter. The Gibbs free energy of each phase is compared against the temperature-dependent Helmholtz energy obtained from the equilibrium structure within the harmonic approximation. We find that the black tetragonal perovskite phase is not dynamically stable up to at least 500 K, with the phonon dispersion displaying negative optic modes, which pass through all of the high-symmetry wave vectors in the Brillouin zone. The main contributions to the negative modes are found to be motions of the Cs atom inside the perovskite cage. The black cubic perovskite structure shows a zone-boundary instability, indicated by soft modes at the special q points M and R. These modes are present in calculations at the equilibrium (0 K) lattice constant, while at finite temperature additional negative modes develop at the zone center, indicating a ferroelectric instability. The yellow crystal, composed of one-dimensional (SnI6)n double chains, has the same heat of formation as the orthorhombic perovskite phase at 0 K, but becomes less energetically favorable at higher temperatures, due to its higher free energy.},

The gap-like structure in the energy spectrum and the enhancement of {$\chi$} {${'}{'}$} ({$\omega$}) survive at  T  c .

  title = {Temperature Effects on the Universal Equation of State of Solids},
  volume = {35},
  abstract = {Recently it has been argued, based on theoretical calculations and experimental data, that there is a universal form for the equation of state of solids. This observation was restricted to the range of temperatures and pressures such that there are no phase transitions. The use of this universal relation to estimate pressure-volume relations (i.e., isotherms) required three input parameters at each fixed temperature. In this paper we show that for many solids the input data needed to predict high-temperature thermodynamical properties can be dramatically reduced. In particular, only four numbers are needed: (1) the zero pressure (P=0) isothermal bulk modulus, (2) its P=0 pressure derivative, (3) the P=0 volume, and (4) the P=0 thermal expansion; all evaluated at a single (reference) temperature. Explicit predictions are made for the high-temperature isotherms, the thermal expansion as a function of temperature, and the temperature variation of the isothermal bulk modulus and its pressure derivative. These predictions are tested using experimental data for three representative solids: gold, sodium chloride, and xenon. Good agreement between theory and experiment is found.},

  abstract = {We assess the performance of recent density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy of a nonmolecular solid, by applying accurate calculations with the GAUSSIAN, BAND, and VASP codes to a test set of 24 solid metals and nonmetals. The functionals tested are the modified Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBEsol GGA), the second-order GGA (SOGGA), and the Armiento-Mattsson 2005 (AM05) GGA. For completeness, we also test more standard functionals: the local density approximation, the original PBE GGA, and the Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria meta-GGA. We find that the recent density functionals for solids reach a high accuracy for bulk properties (lattice constant and bulk modulus). For the cohesive energy, PBE is better than PBEsol overall, as expected, but PBEsol is actually better for the alkali metals and alkali halides. For fair comparison of calculated and experimental results, we consider the zero-point phonon and finite-temperature effects ignored by many workers. We show how GAUSSIAN basis sets and inaccurate experimental reference data may affect the rating of the quality of the functionals. The results show that PBEsol and AM05 perform somewhat differently from each other for alkali metal, alkaline-earth metal, and alkali halide crystals (where the maximum value of the reduced density gradient is about 2), but perform very similarly for most of the other solids (where it is often about 1). Our explanation for this is consistent with the importance of exchange-correlation nonlocality in regions of core-valence overlap.},

For a required accuracy this reduces the number of k points by orders of magnitude. (3) Irreducible k points and tetrahedra are selected by a fully automated procedure, requiring as input only the space-group operations. (4) The integration is formulated as a weighted sum over irreducible k points with integration weights calculated using the tetrahedron method once for a given band structure.

Bonding attractors lie between the core attractors (which themselves surround the atomic nuclei) and characterize the shared-electron interactions. The number of bond attractors is related to the bond multiplicity.

  title = {Optical Spectra of {{La2}}-{{xSrxCuO4}}: {{Effect}} of Carrier Doping on the Electronic Structure of the {{CuO2}} Plane},
  volume = {43},
  abstract = {Optical reflectivity spectra are studied for single crystals of the prototypical high-Tc system La2-xSrxCuO4 over a wide compositional range 0{$\leq$}x{$\leq$}0.34, which covers insulating, superconducting, and normal metallic phases. The measurements are made at room temperature over an energy range from 0.004 to 35 eV for the polarization parallel to the CuO2 planes. They are also extended to the perpendicular polarization to study anisotropy and to discriminate the contribution from the CuO2 plane. The present study focuses on the x dependence of the optical spectrum, which makes it possible to sort out the features of the excitations in the CuO2 plane and thus to characterize the electronic structure of the CuO2 plane in the respective phase. Upon doping into the parent insulator La2CuO4 with a charge-transfer energy gap of about 2 eV the spectral weight is rapidly transferred from the charge-transfer excitation to low-energy excitations below 1.5 eV. The low-energy spectrum is apparently composed of two contributions; a Drude-type one peaked at {$\omega$}=0 and a broad continuum centered in the midinfrared range. The high-Tc superconductivity is realized as doping proceeds and when the transfer of the spectrum weight is saturated. The resulting spectrum in the high-Tc regime is suggestive of a strongly itinerant character of the state in the moderately doped CuO2 plane while appreciable weight remains in the charge-transfer energy region. The spectrum exhibits a second drastic change for heavy doping (x{$\sim$}0.25) corresponding to the superconductor-to-normal-metal transition and becomes close to that of a Fermi liquid. The results are universal for all the known cuprate superconductors including the electron-doped compounds, and they reconcile the dc transport properties with the high-energy spectroscopic results.},

The simulations implement two virtual and one physical (natural) thermostat and examine the kinetic, potential, and total energy correlation functions in the time and frequency domains. The results clearly demonstrate the existence of quasiequilibrium states in which the system can be characterized by a well-defined temperature that follows the mentioned fluctuation equation. The emergence of such states is due to the wide separation of time scales between thermal relaxation by phonon scattering and slow energy exchanges with the thermostat. The quasiequilibrium states exist between these two time scales when the system behaves as virtually isolated and equilibrium.},

  abstract = {The existing phenomenological theory of superconductivity is unsatisfactory, since it does not allow us to determine the surface tension at the boundary between the normal and the superconducting phases, and does not allow for the possibility to describe correctly the destruction of superconductivity by a magnetic field or current. In the present paper, a theory is constructed which is free from these faults. We find equations for the {$\psi$}-function of the `superconducting electrons' which we introduced and for the vector potential. We have solved these equations for the one-dimensional case (a superconducting half-space and flat plates).The theory makes it possible to express the surface tension in terms of the critical magnetic field and the penetration depth of the magnetic field in superconductors. The penetration depth depends in a strong field on the field strength and this effect will be especially evident in the case of small size superconductors. The destruction of superconductivity in thin plates by a magnetic field is through a second-order phase transition, and it only becomes a first-order transition starting with plates of a thickness more than a certain critical thickness. While the critical external magnetic field increases with the decreasing thickness of the plates, the critical current for destroying the superconductivity of plates decreases with decreasing thickness.},

@article{Bardeen1957,
  title = {Theory of {{Superconductivity}}},
  volume = {108},
  abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, {$\hslash\omega$}. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average ({$\hslash\omega$})2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5kTc at T=0\textdegree{}K to zero at Tc. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given., This article appears in the following collection:},

  abstract = {The discovery by J. G. Bednorz and K. A. M{\"u}ller in 1986 that the superconducting state can exist in oxides at temperatures above 30 K stimulated research in the field of superconductivity and opened a new field of research. Within a few years a large number of cuprate superconductors with transition temperatures well above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen have been found. In this chapter, an overview of the major families of high-temperature superconductors and their physical properties is presented.Starting from the well-known characteristics of conventional superconductors, described in Sect. 50.1, the new phenomena observed in high-temperature superconductors are considered. The complexity of the physical properties of the cuprate superconductors is closely related to the fact that these materials are close to a metal\textendash{}insulator transition. In Sects. 50.2 and 50.3, the crystal structures, the general trends for the critical temperatures, the anisotropy of the physical properties, and the factors limiting the transport critical current density are discussed. Because of their importance in the field of electronics some features of thin films are presented in Sect. 50.4.Strictly speaking, the binary compound MgB2 is not a high-temperature superconductor. Nevertheless, an overview of the physical properties of this interesting metallic superconductor, characterized by a transition temperature as high as 39 K, has been included in the present chapter (Sect. 50.5).In 2008, H. Hosono et al. discovered that the layered superconductor La ( O1-xF x ) FeAs (x = 0.11) superconducts at a temperature as high as 26 K. A maximum critical temperature of 58 K has been reported for the iron-pnictide superconductor Sm ( O0.74F0.26 ) FeAs. The iron-based superconductors are therefore considered as a second class of high-temperature superconductors. Their properties are described in Sect. 50.6.},

The dc critical current depends directly on the quantum phase difference of the superconducting wave function on the two sides of the barrier. This paper is an experimental study of interference phenomena in multiply connected superconductors utilizing Josephson tunneling. The results are a striking confirmation of the extensive phase coherence of the superconducting state. London's theory is used in conjunction with Josephson's prediction to explain the observations. Modulation of the maximum supercurrent flow through junction-pair devices was measured in an applied magnetic field and showed periodicities resulting from quantum wave interference. These interference "fringes" were found to occur even when the magnetic flux is confined to a region not accessible to the superconductor. Another experiment allows the measurement of an interference directly attributable to phase modulation by the superconducting electrondrift velocity. These results offer a direct verification of long-range quantum behavior in the superconducting state and further demonstrate the validity and usefulness of Josephson tunneling methods.},

Fr{\"o}hlich predicted the value p=12, but the measurements in some instances show deviations from this prediction. An explanation of the deviation of p from \textonehalf{} is offered based on an analog of Wien's displacement law applicable to the vibration spectrum of real crystal lattices. The departure of p from the value \textonehalf{} is attributed to the departure of the frequency spectrum from a simple power law. For many superconducting elements, p may be estimated from specific heat data, when such data are available to the desired degree of accuracy. A value of p is calculated for Sn which is in good agreement with some of the experiments. The large value 0.73 observed for Pb is shown to be reasonable. The values of p for the other superconducting elements are discussed. It is concluded that the observed deviations of p from \textonehalf{} are not necessarily in conflict with the theories of Fr{\"o}hlich and Bardeen.},

  abstract = {Single-particle spectroscopic probes, such as scanning tunnelling and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), have provided us with crucial insights into the complex electronic structure of the high-Tc cuprates, in particular for the under- and optimally-doped regimes where high-quality crystals suitable for surface-sensitive experiments are available. Conversely, the elementary excitations on the heavily overdoped side of the phase diagram remain largely unexplored. Important breakthroughs could come from the study of Tl2Ba2CuO6+{$\delta$} (Tl2201), a structurally simple system whose doping level can be tuned from optimal to extreme overdoping by varying the oxygen content. Using a self-flux method and encapsulation, we have grown single crystals of Tl2201, which were then carefully annealed under controlled oxygen partial pressures. Their high quality and homogeneity are demonstrated by narrow rocking curves and superconducting transition widths. For higher dopings, the crystals are orthorhombic, a lattice distortion stabilized by O interstitials in the TlO layer. These crystals have enabled the first successful ARPES study of both normal and superconducting-state electronic structure in Tl2201, allowing a direct comparison with the Fermi surface from magnetoresistance and the gap from thermal conductivity experiments. This establishes Tl2201 as the first high-Tc cuprate for which a surface-sensitive single-particle spectroscopy and a comparable bulk transport technique have arrived at quantitative agreement on a major feature such as the normal state Fermi surface. The momentum dependence of the ARPES lineshape reveals, however, an unexpected phenomenology: in contrast to the case of under- and optimally-doped cuprates, quasiparticles are sharp near ({$\pi$},0), the antinodal region where the gap is maximum, and broad at ({$\pi$}/2, {$\pi$}/2), the nodal region where the gap vanishes. This reversed quasiparticle anisotropy past optimal doping, and its relevance to scattering, many-body, and quantum-critical phenomena in the high-Tc cuprates, is discussed.},

A Korringa law and therefore a Fermi-liqud picture is found to apply for the spin part Ks of {$\Delta$}K.

  abstract = {THE superconducting state of a metal is characterized by a complex order parameter with an amplitude and a phase. In the BCS-Eliashberg mean-field theory1, which is a very good approximation for conventional metals, the phase of the order parameter is un-important for determining the value of the transition temperature Tc and the change of many physical properties brought about by the transition. Here we argue that superconductors with low super-conducting carrier density (such as the organic and high-Tc oxide superconductors) are characterized by a relatively small phase 'stiffness9 and poor screening, both of which imply a significantly larger role for phase fluctuations. As a consequence, in these mat-erials the transition to the superconducting state may not display typical mean-field behaviour, and phase fluctuations, both classical and quantum, may have a significant influence on low-temperature properties. For some quasi-two-dimensional materials, notably underdoped high-temperature superconductors, the onset of long-range phase order controls the gross value of Tc as well as its systematic variation from one material to another.},

Above T{$\phi$}, the pseudogap region is determined only by amplitudes, and phases are uncorrelated. Our calculations show excellent quantitative agreement with specific heat and magnetic susceptibility experiments on cuprates.

  abstract = {Pairing symmetry in the cuprate superconductors is an important and controversial topic. The recent development of phase-sensitive tests, combined with the refinement of several other symmetry-sensitive techniques, has for the most part settled this controversy in favor of predominantly d-wave symmetry for a number of optimally hole- and electron-doped cuprates. This paper begins by reviewing the concepts of the order parameter, symmetry breaking, and symmetry classification in the context of the cuprates. After a brief survey of some of the key non-phase-sensitive tests of pairing symmetry, the authors extensively review the phase-sensitive methods, which use the half-integer flux-quantum effect as an unambiguous signature for d-wave pairing symmetry. A number of related symmetry-sensitive experiments are described. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the implications, both fundamental and applied, of the predominantly d-wave pairing symmetry in the cuprates.},

First, the authors show how the normal-state properties of Sr2RuO4 are quantitatively described in terms of a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi liquid. Then they summarize its phenomenological superconducting parameters in the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau model, and discuss the existing evidence for spin-triplet pairing. After a brief introduction to the vector order parameter, they examine the most likely symmetry of the triplet state. The structure of the superconducting energy gap is discussed, as is the effect of symmetry-breaking magnetic fields on the phase diagram. The article concludes with a discussion of some outstanding issues and desirable future work. Appendixes on additional details of the normal state, difficulty in observing the bulk Fermi surface by angle-resolved photoemission, and the enhancement of superconducting transition temperature in a two-phase Sr2RuO4-Ru system are included.},

  title = {The Superconducting Phases of {{UPt3}}},
  volume = {74},
  abstract = {The heavy-fermion compound UPt3 is the first compelling example of a superconductor with an order parameter of unconventional symmetry. To this day, it is the only unambiguous case of multiple superconducting phases. Twenty years of experiment and theory on the superconductivity of UPt3 are reviewed, with the aim of accounting for the multicomponent phase diagram and identifying the superconducting phases. First, the state above the superconducting critical temperature at Tc=0.5K is briefly described: de Haas\textendash{}van Alphen and other measurements demonstrate that this state is a Fermi liquid, with degeneracy fully achieved at Tc. This implies that the usual BCS theory of superconductivity should hold, although the strong magnetic interactions suggest the possibility of an unconventional superconducting order parameter. The role of the weak antiferromagnetic order below TN=5K in causing phase multiplicity is examined. A comprehensive analysis of which superconducting states are possible is given, and the theoretical basis for each of the main candidates is considered. The behavior of various properties at low temperature (T{$\ll$}Tc) is reviewed. The experiments clearly indicate the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap function of all three phases. In particular, the low-temperature low-field phase has a gap with a line node in the basal plane and point nodes along the hexagonal c axis. The phase diagram in the magnetic-field\textendash{}temperature plane has been determined in detail by ultrasound and thermodynamic measurements. Experiments under pressure indicate a coupling between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity and provide additional clues about the order parameter. Theoretically, Ginzburg-Landau theory is the tool that elucidates the phase diagram, while calculations of the temperature and field dependence of physical quantities have been used to compare different order parameters to experiment. On balance, the data point to a two-component order parameter belonging to either the E1g or the E2u representation, with degeneracy lifted by a coupling to the symmetry-breaking magnetic order. However, no single theoretical scenario is completely consistent with all the data. The coupling of superconductivity and magnetism may be the weakest link in the current picture of UPt3, and full understanding depends on the resolution of this issue.},
