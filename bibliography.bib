  abstract = {We present a volume-sensitive high-energy x-ray diffraction study of the underdoped cuprate high temperature superconductor La2-xSrxCuO4 (x = 0.12, Tc=27 K) in applied magnetic field. Bulk short-range charge stripe order with propagation vector q\_ch = (0.231, 0, 0.5) is demonstrated to exist below T\_ch = 85(10) K and shown to compete with superconductivity. We argue that bulk charge ordering arises from fluctuating stripes that become pinned near boundaries between orthorhombic twin domains.},

  abstract = {Despite over two decades of intense research efforts, the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides remains elusive. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments1,2 have revealed a kink in the dispersion relations (energy versus wavevector) of electronic states in the copper oxides at binding energies of 50-80 meV, raising the hope that this anomaly could be a key to understanding high-temperature superconductivity. The kink is often interpreted in terms of interactions between the electrons and a bosonic field. Although there is no consensus on the nature of the bosons (or even whether a boson model is appropriate), both phonons1 and spin fluctuations2 have been proposed as possible candidates. Here we report first-principles calculations of the role of phonons and the electron\textendash{}phonon interaction in the photoemission spectra of La2 - xSrxCuO4. Our calculations within the standard formalism demonstrate that the phonon-induced renormalization of the electron energies and the Fermi velocity is almost one order of magnitude smaller than the effect observed in photoemission experiments. Therefore, our result rules out electron\textendash{}phonon interaction in bulk La2 - xSrxCuO4 as the exclusive origin of the measured kink. Our conclusions are consistent with those reached independently in a recent study3 of the related compound YBa2Cu3O7.},

  volume = {89},
  abstract = {In superconducting copper oxides, some Cu-O bond-stretching phonons around 70 meV show anomalous giant softening and broadening of electronic origin, and electronic dispersions have large renormalization kinks near the same energy. These observations suggest that phonon broadening originates from quasiparticle excitations across the Fermi surface and the electronic dispersion kinks originate from coupling to anomalous phonons. We measured the phonon anomaly in underdoped (x=0.05) and overdoped (x=0.20 and 0.25) La2-xSrxCuO4 by inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering with high resolution. Combining these and previously published data, we found that doping dependence of the magnitude of the giant phonon anomaly is very different from that of the ARPES kink, i.e., the two phenomena are not connected. We show that these results provide indirect evidence that the phonon anomaly originates from novel collective charge excitations as opposed to interactions with electron-hole pairs. Their amplitude follows the superconducting dome so these charge modes may be important for superconductivity.},

This complex, multiscale phase separation18,19,20,21 invites the development of theories of high-temperature superconductivity that include complexity22,23,24,25. The nature of the spatial interplay between charge and dopant order that provides a basis for nanoscale phase separation remains a key open question, because experiments have yet to probe the unknown spatial distribution at both the nanoscale and mesoscale (between atomic and macroscopic scale). Here we report micro X-ray diffraction imaging of the spatial distribution of both short-range charge-density-wave `puddles' (domains with only a few wavelengths) and quenched disorder in HgBa2CuO4 + y, the single-layer cuprate with the highest Tc, 95 kelvin (refs 26, 27, 28). We found that the charge-density-wave puddles, like the steam bubbles in boiling water, have a fat-tailed size distribution that is typical of self-organization near a critical point19. However, the quenched disorder, which arises from oxygen interstitials, has a distribution that is contrary to the usually assumed random, uncorrelated distribution12,13. The interstitial-oxygen-rich domains are spatially anticorrelated with the charge-density-wave domains, because higher doping does not favour the stripy charge-density-wave puddles, leading to a complex emergent geometry of the spatial landscape for superconductivity.},

  abstract = {Electronic functionalities in materials from silicon to transition metal oxides are, to a large extent, controlled by defects and their relative arrangement. Outstanding examples are the oxides of copper, where defect order is correlated with their high superconducting transition temperatures. The oxygen defect order can be highly inhomogeneous, even in optimal superconducting samples, which raises the question of the nature of the sample regions where the order does not exist but which nonetheless form the ``glue'' binding the ordered regions together. Here we use scanning X-ray microdiffraction (with a beam 300 nm in diameter) to show that for La2CuO4+y, the glue regions contain incommensurate modulated local lattice distortions, whose spatial extent is most pronounced for the best superconducting samples. For an underdoped single crystal with mobile oxygen interstitials in the spacer La2O2+y layers intercalated between the CuO2 layers, the incommensurate modulated local lattice distortions form droplets anticorrelated with the ordered oxygen interstitials, and whose spatial extent is most pronounced for the best superconducting samples. In this simplest of high temperature superconductors, there are therefore not one, but two networks of ordered defects which can be tuned to achieve optimal superconductivity. For a given stoichiometry, the highest transition temperature is obtained when both the ordered oxygen and lattice defects form fractal patterns, as opposed to appearing in isolated spots. We speculate that the relationship between material complexity and superconducting transition temperature Tc is actually underpinned by a fundamental relation between Tc and the distribution of ordered defect networks supported by the materials.},

As shown in previous work, these samples spontaneously phase separate into an oxygen-rich superconducting phase with a TC near 40 K and an oxygen poor magnetic phase that also orders near 40 K. The oxygenated samples studied are highly magnetically reversible even to low temperatures. Although the internal magnetic regions of these samples might be expected to act as pinning sites, our present study shows that they do not favor flux pinning. Flux pinning requires a matching condition between the defect size and the superconducting coherence length. Thus, our results imply that the magnetic regions are too large to act as pinning centers. This also implies that the much greater flux pinning in typical La2-xSrxCuO4 materials is the result of nanoscale inhomogeneities that grow to become the large magnetic regions in the superoxygenated materials. The superconducting regions of the phase separated materials are in that sense cleaner and more homogenous than in the typical cuprate superconductor.},

Many believe that antiferromagnetism is important for superconductivity, but there has been renewed interest in the possible role of electron\textendash{}lattice coupling1,2,3,4. The conventional superconductor MgB2 has a very strong electron\textendash{}lattice coupling, involving a particular vibrational mode (phonon) that was predicted by standard theory and confirmed quantitatively by experiment5. Here we present inelastic scattering measurements that show a similarly strong anomaly in the Cu\textendash{}O bond-stretching phonon in the copper oxide superconductors La2-xSrxCuO4 (with x = 0.07, 0.15). Conventional theory does not predict such behaviour. The anomaly is strongest in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 and La1.48Nd0.4Sr0.12CuO4, compounds that exhibit spatially modulated charge and magnetic order, often called stripe order6; it occurs at a wave vector corresponding to the charge order. These results suggest that this giant electron\textendash{}phonon anomaly, which is absent in undoped and over-doped non-superconductors, is associated with charge inhomogeneity. It follows that electron\textendash{}phonon coupling may be important to our understanding of superconductivity, although its contribution is likely to be indirect.},

The LDA+U method takes into account orbital dependence of the Coulomb and exchange interactions which is absent in the LDA. The scheme can be regarded as a `first-principles' method because there are no adjustable parameters. When applied to the transition metal and rare-earth metal compounds, the LDA+U method gives a qualitative improvement compared with the LDA not only for excited-state properties such as energy gaps but also for ground-state properties such as magnetic moments and interatomic exchange parameters. The orbital-dependent rotationally invariant LDA+U potential gives a correct orbital polarization and a corresponding Jahn - Teller distortion as well as polaron formation.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of superconductivity above 30 K by Bednorz and M{\"u}ller in the La copper oxide system, the critical temperature has been raised to 90 K in YBa2Cu3O7 and to 110 and 125 K in Bi-based and Tl-based copper oxides, respectively. In the two years since this Nobel-prize-winning discovery, a large number of electronic structure calculations have been carried out as a first step in understanding the electronic properties of these materials. In this paper these calculations (mostly of the density-functional type) are gathered and reviewed, and their results are compared with the relevant experimental data. The picture that emerges is one in which the important electronic states are dominated by the copper d and oxygen p orbitals, with strong hybridization between them. Photon, electron, and positron spectroscopies provide important information about the electronic states, and comparison with electronic structure calculations indicates that, while many features can be interpreted in terms of existing calculations, self-energy corrections ("correlations") are important for a more detailed understanding. The antiferromagnetism that occurs in some regions of the phase diagram poses a particularly challenging problem for any detailed theory. The study of structural stability, lattice dynamics, and electron-phonon coupling in the copper oxides is also discussed. Finally, a brief review is given of the attempts so far to identify interaction constants appropriate for a model Hamiltonian treatment of many-body interactions in these materials.},

  abstract = {A growing number of cuprate superconductors show evidence of an intrinsic spatial electronic inhomogeneity on a nanometer length scale. Corresponding observations were made with a variety of probes sensitive to the sample's surface or bulk as well as to its average or local structure. Charge and spin stripe correlations constitute one class of inhomogeneity initially derived from neutron scattering data on La-based cuprates. By now magnetic excitation spectra with very similar dispersions were observed in several systems, suggesting that incommensurate spin fluctuations are a universal property of the cuprates. In contrast, it proves much harder to obtain a unified picture for the charge stripe correlations as observed with scattering and tunneling techniques. This article reviews the evidence of charge stripe correlations and their interactions with the crystal lattice in the La-based compounds, which are presently the only cuprates with confirmed static spin and charge stripe order. Particular emphasis is put on the relationship between stripe order and average and local structure properties, isotope effects, phonon anomalies, and doping dependencies. A second important topic concerns new insights obtained in studies of stripes under extreme conditions such as high magnetic fields and high pressure. Furthermore, the tilting of stripes in orthorhombic lattices will be discussed, as well as the possibility of diagonal charge stripes below the metal insulator transition, and alternative models for the stripe phase.},

On the other hand, Zn-doped LSCO and LSCO with x=0.02\textendash{}0.07 show an exponential temperature dependence, and the correlation lengths stay short. This discrepancy can be attributed to the difference in the mechanism of pinning spin fluctuations. The former systems have pinning centers which are coherent to the lattice. In the latter, however, pinning centers are randomly scattered in the CuO2 planes, thus incoherent. The incoherent pinning model is discussed with referring to recent {$\mu$}SR studies.},

  abstract = {Systematic and automatic calculations of the electronic band structure are a crucial component of computationally-driven high-throughput materials screening. An algorithm, for any crystal, to derive a unique description of the crystal structure together with a recommended band path is indispensable for this task. The electronic band structure is typically sampled along a path within the first Brillouin zone including the surface in reciprocal space. Some points in reciprocal space have higher site symmetries and/or have higher constraints than other points regarding the electronic band structure and therefore are likely to be more important than other points. This work categorizes points in reciprocal space according to their symmetry and provides recommended band paths that cover all special wavevector (k-vector) points and lines necessarily and sufficiently. Points in reciprocal space are labeled such that there is no conflict with the crystallographic convention. The k-vector coefficients of labeled points, which are located at Brillouin zone face and edge centers as well as vertices, are derived based on a primitive cell compatible with the crystallographic convention, including those with axial ratio-dependent coordinates. Furthermore, we provide an open-source implementation of the algorithms within our SeeK-path python code, to allow researchers to obtain k-vector coefficients and recommended band paths in an automated fashion. Finally, we created a free online service to compute and visualize the first Brillouin zone, labeled k-points and suggested band paths for any crystal structure, that we made available at http://www.materialscloud.org/tools/seekpath/.},

Here we examine the possibility that this effect is related to dynamical two-dimensional spin correlations, incommensurate with the crystal lattice, that have been observed in La2-xSrxCuO4 by neutron scattering24. A possible explanation for the incommensurability involves a coupled, dynamical modulation of spin and charge in which antiferromagnetic 'stripes' of copper spins are separated by periodically spaced domain walls to which the holes segregate59. An ordered stripe phase of this type has recently been observed in hole-doped La2NiO4 (refs 1012). We present evidence from neutron diffraction that in the copper oxide material La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4, with x = 0.12, a static analogue of the dynamical stripe phase is present, and is associated with an anomalous suppression of superconductivity13,14. Our results thus provide an explanation of the '{$\textfrac{1}{8}$}' conundrum, and also support the suggestion15 that spatial modulations of spin and charge density are related to superconductivity in the copper oxides.},

At 300 K, all of the crystals have an average tetragonal structure (space group I4/mmm). On cooling below 290 K, one or more orthorhombic phases appear, characterized by incommensurate superlattice peaks at (0,k,l{$\pm\Delta$}) with k odd, l even, and 1/4{$<\Delta\leq$}1/2. The positions, widths, and intensities of the superlattice peaks are quite sensitive to the cooling rate. We show that the incommensurate peaks are evidence of intercalated layers of oxygen spaced periodically along the c axis, with a one-dimensional ordering similar to the staging of intercalates in graphite. The structure of the La2NiO4 lattice between the interstitial layers is of the Bmab-type; the superlattice peaks result from the ordered antiphase domain boundaries induced by the interstitial oxygens, which sit at (1/4, 1) / 4 , 1/4)-type positions. Observed orderings involve interstitial layers separated by two to four Ni-O layers. Peak shapes and positions are modelled quantitatively using the formulas of Hendricks and Teller for one-dimensional disorder in a layer lattice. Besides the one-dimensional ordering of the intercalant layers, temperature-dependent phase separations are observed. Because of the slow ordering kinetics, phase separation can be suppressed by rapid cooling.},

In the first part the application of Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order N3atoms operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay's scheme. A special ``metric'' and a special ``preconditioning'' optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order N2atoms scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. \textcopyright{} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

We will discuss: (a) partial occupancies within the framework of the linear tetrahedron method and the finite temperature density-functional theory, (b) iterative methods for the diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion of an efficient iterative method based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization, which is close to an order Natoms2 scaling even for relatively large systems, (c) efficient Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing methods for the charge density including a new special `preconditioning' optimized for a plane-wave basis set, (d) conjugate gradient methods for minimizing the electronic free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom simultaneously. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.},

  abstract = {We employ the quasiharmonic approximation to study the temperature-dependent lattice dynamics of the four different phases of cesium tin iodide (CsSnI3). Within this framework, we obtain the temperature dependence of a number of structural properties, including the cell volume, bulk modulus, and Gr{\"u}neisen parameter. The Gibbs free energy of each phase is compared against the temperature-dependent Helmholtz energy obtained from the equilibrium structure within the harmonic approximation. We find that the black tetragonal perovskite phase is not dynamically stable up to at least 500 K, with the phonon dispersion displaying negative optic modes, which pass through all of the high-symmetry wave vectors in the Brillouin zone. The main contributions to the negative modes are found to be motions of the Cs atom inside the perovskite cage. The black cubic perovskite structure shows a zone-boundary instability, indicated by soft modes at the special q points M and R. These modes are present in calculations at the equilibrium (0 K) lattice constant, while at finite temperature additional negative modes develop at the zone center, indicating a ferroelectric instability. The yellow crystal, composed of one-dimensional (SnI6)n double chains, has the same heat of formation as the orthorhombic perovskite phase at 0 K, but becomes less energetically favorable at higher temperatures, due to its higher free energy.},

For example, scanning tunneling spectroscopic imaging shows strong variations in real space, and according to nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) studies, the charge distribution in the bulk varies on the nanoscale. However, the analysis of the experimental results utilizing spatially averaged probes often ignores this fact. We have performed a detailed investigation of the doping dependence of the energy and linewidth of the zone-boundary Cu-O bond-stretching vibration in La2-xSrxCuO4 by inelastic neutron scattering.

The gap-like structure in the energy spectrum and the enhancement of {$\chi$} {${'}{'}$} ({$\omega$}) survive at  T  c .

The computed values of the band gap (1.00 eV) and the exchange coupling (-138 meV) match the corresponding experimental values. We identify interesting band splittings below the Fermi energy, including an appreciable Hund's splitting of 1.25 eV. The magnetic form factor obtained from neutron scattering experiments is also well described by our calculations. Our study thus opens up a pathway for first-principles investigations of electronic and atomic structures and phase diagrams of cuprates and other complex materials.},

  title = {Temperature Effects on the Universal Equation of State of Solids},
  volume = {35},
  abstract = {Recently it has been argued, based on theoretical calculations and experimental data, that there is a universal form for the equation of state of solids. This observation was restricted to the range of temperatures and pressures such that there are no phase transitions. The use of this universal relation to estimate pressure-volume relations (i.e., isotherms) required three input parameters at each fixed temperature. In this paper we show that for many solids the input data needed to predict high-temperature thermodynamical properties can be dramatically reduced. In particular, only four numbers are needed: (1) the zero pressure (P=0) isothermal bulk modulus, (2) its P=0 pressure derivative, (3) the P=0 volume, and (4) the P=0 thermal expansion; all evaluated at a single (reference) temperature. Explicit predictions are made for the high-temperature isotherms, the thermal expansion as a function of temperature, and the temperature variation of the isothermal bulk modulus and its pressure derivative. These predictions are tested using experimental data for three representative solids: gold, sodium chloride, and xenon. Good agreement between theory and experiment is found.},

  abstract = {We assess the performance of recent density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy of a nonmolecular solid, by applying accurate calculations with the GAUSSIAN, BAND, and VASP codes to a test set of 24 solid metals and nonmetals. The functionals tested are the modified Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBEsol GGA), the second-order GGA (SOGGA), and the Armiento-Mattsson 2005 (AM05) GGA. For completeness, we also test more standard functionals: the local density approximation, the original PBE GGA, and the Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria meta-GGA. We find that the recent density functionals for solids reach a high accuracy for bulk properties (lattice constant and bulk modulus). For the cohesive energy, PBE is better than PBEsol overall, as expected, but PBEsol is actually better for the alkali metals and alkali halides. For fair comparison of calculated and experimental results, we consider the zero-point phonon and finite-temperature effects ignored by many workers. We show how GAUSSIAN basis sets and inaccurate experimental reference data may affect the rating of the quality of the functionals. The results show that PBEsol and AM05 perform somewhat differently from each other for alkali metal, alkaline-earth metal, and alkali halide crystals (where the maximum value of the reduced density gradient is about 2), but perform very similarly for most of the other solids (where it is often about 1). Our explanation for this is consistent with the importance of exchange-correlation nonlocality in regions of core-valence overlap.},

The Hamilton operator, the forces, and the stress tensor are derived for this modified PAW functional. A simple way to implement the PAW method in existing plane-wave codes supporting US pseudopotentials is pointed out. In addition, critical tests are presented to compare the accuracy and efficiency of the PAW and the US pseudopotential method with relaxed core all electron methods. These tests include small molecules (H2,H2O,Li2,N2,F2,BF3,SiF4) and several bulk systems (diamond, Si, V, Li, Ca, CaF2, Fe, Co, Ni).

For a required accuracy this reduces the number of k points by orders of magnitude. (3) Irreducible k points and tetrahedra are selected by a fully automated procedure, requiring as input only the space-group operations. (4) The integration is formulated as a weighted sum over irreducible k points with integration weights calculated using the tetrahedron method once for a given band structure.
