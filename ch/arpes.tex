In this brief chapter, we take a look at the Fermi surface as measured by Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) on a sample of La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. Tha majority of the experimental work was performed with assistance from Johan Chang's group at the Laboratory for Quantum Matter Research (LQMR) in Z\"urich, Switzerland. I mention in particular Masafumi Horio, who helped me prepare the samples and did all of the data analysis. I was present at the measurements, but success would not have been possible without the expertise of the LQMR group.

While the analysis presented here is \emph{very} preliminary, I include it because it is, to my knowledge, the first ARPES experiment performed on an oxygen doped La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ sample. Since these samples are known to phase separate electronically \cite{Udby2013}, we expect a superposition of a magnetic `$\frac{1}{8}$' phase and an optimally superconducting phase. It is possible that we could see some of this behavior in an ARPES experiment.

The fermi surface evolution of \LSCO{} is shown in figure \ref{fig:lsco_fs}, indicating how the broken Fermi arcs at $\left( \frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2} \right)$ become connected at optimal doping. Since La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ is phase separated, we would expect to see signatures of either $x=0.1$, $x=0.15$ or both. The naive expectation would be a superposition of the two, removing any signature of the $\frac{1}{8}$ phase. In this context, I also mention the fact that \LNSCO{} (stripe ordered, insulating) and \LSCOopt{} (optimally doped, $T_\text{c} = \SI{37}{\kelvin}$) have curiously similar Fermi surfaces despite being electronically distinct \cite{Zhou2001}.

\section{Sample}
The sample is a small piece ($\approx \SI{1}{\centi\meter\cubed}$) of La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, carefully cut with the $c$-axis vertical. Before cutting the sample, we characterized it with a Laue camera and magnetization measurements as shown in figure \ref{fig:arpes_vsm}. When performing ARPES experiments, you need an atomically flat surface. Since La$_2$CuO$_4$ is a very brittle material, the only way to do this is by gluing on a small pin, knocking it off and hoping that the sample breaks in an atomically sharp way. Luckily, the 2-dimensional nature of the cuprates also translate to their structural integrity, so they are likely to cleave naturally at the CuO$_2$ interface. Before going to the ARPES experiment, the procedure was tested in the lab as shown in figure \ref{fig:arpes_cleave}.

\section{Experiment}
ARPES experiments were carried out on the La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ sample at the Surface/Interface Spectroscopy (SIS) beamline at the Swiss Light Source. The sample was cleaved in situ at $\approx 20\,\text{K}$ under ultra high vacuum ($\leq 5 \times 10^{-11}\,\text{Torr}$) by employing the top-post technique as shown in figure \ref{fig:arpes_cleave}. Cleaving in vacuum is essentially the same procedure as our ambient test-case, made possible with a screwdriver that we can control from outside the vacuum chamber. Ultraviolet ARPES spectra were recorded using a SCIENTA R4000 electron analyser with horizontal slit setting. All the data were recorded at the cleaving temperature. Figure \ref{fig:arpes_fs} shows the Fermi surface map at $T=22\,\text{K}$ recorded using circularly polarized $160\,\text{eV}$ phonons. Detailed cut along the nodal direction with circularly polarized light is shown in Figure \ref{fig:arpes_cut1}. A comparison of different photon polarizations along with data from La$_{1.77}$Sr$_{0.23}$CuO$_4$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:arpes_cut2}.

\section{Summary}

The area of the Fermi surface as shown in Figure \ref{fig:arpes_fs} corresponds to a carrier (hole) doping $n_\text{h} = 0.16$ and a hopping parameter $\frac{t^\prime}{t} \approx -0.14$, according to analysis performed by Masafumi Horio from the LMQR group.
It turns out that the measured spectra as e.g. the cut shown in Figure \ref{fig:arpes_cut1} are very similar to what was observed by the LMQR group in overdoped La$_{1.77}$Sr$_{0.23}$CuO$_4$ \cite{Horio2018}. There is thus no indication of `$\frac{1}{8}$-physics' which is generally characterized by the formation of Fermi arcs. We cannot however rule out that such arcs are not observed due to an unfavorable superposition of photoemission from the 1/8 phase and optimally doped phase in our sample.  

By using different polarizations of light (linear horizontal and linear vertical) Figure \ref{fig:arpes_cut2} shows that we can separate the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band from the $d_{z^2}$ band. In the same figure, data from overdoped La$_{1.77}$Sr$_{0.23}$CuO$_4$ \cite{Horio2018} is shown. The band structure is very similar except that the $d_{z^2}$ band is moved down by about $\SI{0.2}{\eV}$. This could be due to an elongation of the $c$-axis, but while oxygen-doped samples are elongated when compared to the parent compound, La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ has a similar (or even smaller) $c$-axis when compared to La$_{1.77}$Sr$_{0.23}$CuO$_4$.

Thus there must be another explanation for the decreased energy of the $d_z$ band further away from the Fermi energy. Maybe the coupling along $c$ is weakened by oxygen-doping and this in fact enhancing $T_\text{c}$ for oxygen doped samples? There is some evidence that relieving Josephson frustration along $c$ gives 2D superconductivity with $T_\text{c} = \SI{40}{\kelvin}$ \cite{Li2007}.
