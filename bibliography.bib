Static stripes detected as extra peaks in diffraction patterns, appear in a number of oxide perovskites as well as some other systems. The more controversial dynamic stripes, which are not detectable by diffraction, may be universally present in copper oxide superconductors. Thus it is important to learn how to detect dynamic stripes as well as to understand their influence on electronic properties. This review article focuses on lattice vibrations (phonons) that might show signatures of the charge component of dynamic stripes. The first part of the article describes recent progress in learning about how the phonon signatures of different types of electronic charge fluctuations including stripes can be distinguished from purely structural instabilities and from each other. Then I will focus on the evidence for dynamic stripes in the phonon spectra of copper oxide superconductors.},

  volume = {89},
  abstract = {In superconducting copper oxides, some Cu-O bond-stretching phonons around 70 meV show anomalous giant softening and broadening of electronic origin, and electronic dispersions have large renormalization kinks near the same energy. These observations suggest that phonon broadening originates from quasiparticle excitations across the Fermi surface and the electronic dispersion kinks originate from coupling to anomalous phonons. We measured the phonon anomaly in underdoped (x=0.05) and overdoped (x=0.20 and 0.25) La2-xSrxCuO4 by inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering with high resolution. Combining these and previously published data, we found that doping dependence of the magnitude of the giant phonon anomaly is very different from that of the ARPES kink, i.e., the two phenomena are not connected. We show that these results provide indirect evidence that the phonon anomaly originates from novel collective charge excitations as opposed to interactions with electron-hole pairs. Their amplitude follows the superconducting dome so these charge modes may be important for superconductivity.},

  abstract = {The attempt to understand copper oxide superconductors is complicated by the presence of multiple strong interactions in these systems. Many believe that antiferromagnetism is important for superconductivity, but there has been renewed interest in the possible role of electron\textendash{}lattice coupling1,2,3,4. The conventional superconductor MgB2 has a very strong electron\textendash{}lattice coupling, involving a particular vibrational mode (phonon) that was predicted by standard theory and confirmed quantitatively by experiment5. Here we present inelastic scattering measurements that show a similarly strong anomaly in the Cu\textendash{}O bond-stretching phonon in the copper oxide superconductors La2-xSrxCuO4 (with x = 0.07, 0.15). Conventional theory does not predict such behaviour. The anomaly is strongest in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 and La1.48Nd0.4Sr0.12CuO4, compounds that exhibit spatially modulated charge and magnetic order, often called stripe order6; it occurs at a wave vector corresponding to the charge order. These results suggest that this giant electron\textendash{}phonon anomaly, which is absent in undoped and over-doped non-superconductors, is associated with charge inhomogeneity. It follows that electron\textendash{}phonon coupling may be important to our understanding of superconductivity, although its contribution is likely to be indirect.},

At 300 K, all of the crystals have an average tetragonal structure (space group I4/mmm). On cooling below 290 K, one or more orthorhombic phases appear, characterized by incommensurate superlattice peaks at (0,k,l{$\pm\Delta$}) with k odd, l even, and 1/4{$<\Delta\leq$}1/2. The positions, widths, and intensities of the superlattice peaks are quite sensitive to the cooling rate. We show that the incommensurate peaks are evidence of intercalated layers of oxygen spaced periodically along the c axis, with a one-dimensional ordering similar to the staging of intercalates in graphite. The structure of the La2NiO4 lattice between the interstitial layers is of the Bmab-type; the superlattice peaks result from the ordered antiphase domain boundaries induced by the interstitial oxygens, which sit at (1/4, 1) / 4 , 1/4)-type positions. Observed orderings involve interstitial layers separated by two to four Ni-O layers. Peak shapes and positions are modelled quantitatively using the formulas of Hendricks and Teller for one-dimensional disorder in a layer lattice. Besides the one-dimensional ordering of the intercalant layers, temperature-dependent phase separations are observed. Because of the slow ordering kinetics, phase separation can be suppressed by rapid cooling.},

  abstract = {A growing number of cuprate superconductors show evidence of an intrinsic spatial electronic inhomogeneity on a nanometer length scale. Corresponding observations were made with a variety of probes sensitive to the sample's surface or bulk as well as to its average or local structure. Charge and spin stripe correlations constitute one class of inhomogeneity initially derived from neutron scattering data on La-based cuprates. By now magnetic excitation spectra with very similar dispersions were observed in several systems, suggesting that incommensurate spin fluctuations are a universal property of the cuprates. In contrast, it proves much harder to obtain a unified picture for the charge stripe correlations as observed with scattering and tunneling techniques. This article reviews the evidence of charge stripe correlations and their interactions with the crystal lattice in the La-based compounds, which are presently the only cuprates with confirmed static spin and charge stripe order. Particular emphasis is put on the relationship between stripe order and average and local structure properties, isotope effects, phonon anomalies, and doping dependencies. A second important topic concerns new insights obtained in studies of stripes under extreme conditions such as high magnetic fields and high pressure. Furthermore, the tilting of stripes in orthorhombic lattices will be discussed, as well as the possibility of diagonal charge stripes below the metal insulator transition, and alternative models for the stripe phase.},

Pintschovius in 2005 showed that electron-phonon coupling in the cuprates is surprisingly strong for some phonons and its role is controversial. Experiments performed since then identified anomalous behavior of certain Cu\textendash{}O bond-stretching phonons in cuprates as an important phenomenon that is somehow related to the mechanism of superconductivity.

Here we examine the possibility that this effect is related to dynamical two-dimensional spin correlations, incommensurate with the crystal lattice, that have been observed in La2-xSrxCuO4 by neutron scattering24. A possible explanation for the incommensurability involves a coupled, dynamical modulation of spin and charge in which antiferromagnetic 'stripes' of copper spins are separated by periodically spaced domain walls to which the holes segregate59. An ordered stripe phase of this type has recently been observed in hole-doped La2NiO4 (refs 1012). We present evidence from neutron diffraction that in the copper oxide material La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4, with x = 0.12, a static analogue of the dynamical stripe phase is present, and is associated with an anomalous suppression of superconductivity13,14. Our results thus provide an explanation of the '{$\textfrac{1}{8}$}' conundrum, and also support the suggestion15 that spatial modulations of spin and charge density are related to superconductivity in the copper oxides.},

  abstract = {Recently it has been argued, based on theoretical calculations and experimental data, that there is a universal form for the equation of state of solids. This observation was restricted to the range of temperatures and pressures such that there are no phase transitions. The use of this universal relation to estimate pressure-volume relations (i.e., isotherms) required three input parameters at each fixed temperature. In this paper we show that for many solids the input data needed to predict high-temperature thermodynamical properties can be dramatically reduced. In particular, only four numbers are needed: (1) the zero pressure (P=0) isothermal bulk modulus, (2) its P=0 pressure derivative, (3) the P=0 volume, and (4) the P=0 thermal expansion; all evaluated at a single (reference) temperature. Explicit predictions are made for the high-temperature isotherms, the thermal expansion as a function of temperature, and the temperature variation of the isothermal bulk modulus and its pressure derivative. These predictions are tested using experimental data for three representative solids: gold, sodium chloride, and xenon. Good agreement between theory and experiment is found.},
