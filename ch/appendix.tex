\chapter{A short guide to navigating phonon data}

PhonoPy is rich on features, check settings tags. Most things can be done without resorting to the python interface. There are, however a few caveats when we are interested in generating customized plots and working with eigenvectors.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Check modulations with phonon website
    \item Use modulation feature of phonopy to generate desired modulations
    \item Python interface can be used to generate band structure plots
    \item Python interface can be used to generate $S(q,\omega)$
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Phonon calculation formalism}
In most textbooks (e.g. Kittel \cite{Kittel2005}), phonon calculations are exemplified by simple models in one dimension consisting of only one or two inequivalent atoms. While these models are useful for providing basic results of lattice dynamical models, the extension to realistic models requires some level of abstraction. In particular, it is essential to cast the problem in terms of linear algebra. In this section, I will attempt to perform this abstraction starting from the diatomic chain. While software such as PHONON \cite{Parlinski1997} and Phonopy \cite{Togo2015} can be used without prior knowledge of the formalism, it is always useful to have some insights about our frequently used 'black boxes`.

The diamtomic chain is visualized in Figure XX. It is an infinite chain of alternating (1,2) atoms with distinct masses ($m$,$M$) in a unit cell of length $a$. Displacements from equilibrium positions are denoted with $u$.



\[ E = E_0 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial r^2} \sum_n (r - r_0)^2 + \frac{1}{3!} \frac{\partial^3 E}{\partial r^3} \sum_n (r - r_0)^3 + \dots \]
